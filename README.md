Streaming data from coinbase to learn more about how websockets work

The coinbase pro live charts look really cool, like watching virtual money fly around at the speed of light

Problem: I have a laptop, and I'm guessing that coinbase has slightly better computers
Still, I think I should be able to keep the programming running for a bit

The project will require a spark environment to eat streaming data, and coinbase's API to allow access to their websocket
If you want to do that on your local laptop, you need to download a spark distribution, and get a coinbase pro account

Coinbase website doesn't really work for issuing API keys, and the support agent just immediately closed my case when I called them. 
They seem like they are having a lot of trouble with support right now

Onto other websites that work better!
